# File manifest tools: Damage

Damage is a simple command-line utility which outputs a file manifest in a variety of formats, with a special focus on statistical package files from SPSS, SAS and Stata. It's also the name of the Python package which you can use in your own code and which powers the _damage_ utility.

Source code and documentation files are available at <https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/damage>. Documentation is in the intuitively named _docs_ subdirectory. 

Binary versions of the *damage* utility for Windows and MacOS computers can be found on the project's Github release page: <https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/damage/releases>.

A less utilitarian documentation viewing experience is available at <https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/damage/>.
