# File manifest tools: Damage and FCheck

Damage is a simple command-line utility which outputs a file manifest in a variety of formats, with a special focus on statistical package files from SPSS, SAS and Stata. FCheck is the Python 3 module which you can use in your own code and which powers the _damage_ utility.

Source code and documentation files are available at <https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/fcheck>. Fcheck is a single module; it's found at the top level as _fcheck.py_. Documentation is in the intuitively named _docs_ subdirectory. 

Binary versions of the *damage* utility for Windows and MacOS computers can be found on the project's Github release page: <https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/fcheck/releases>.

A less utilitarian documentation viewing experience is available at <https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/fcheck>.
