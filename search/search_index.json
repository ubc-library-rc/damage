Multiple flavours! \u00b6 Damage comes as both a traditional application (with a handy user interface) or as console utility running in your Windows command prompt/PowerShell/bash session. Download the newest binary version of Damage here: Download Damage A created manifest includes, for all file types: The file name Checksum in your choice of hash for the file. Current flavours of hashes are: sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512, blake2b, blake2s, md5 Encoding, if available (ie, utf-8, windows-1252, etc.) For plain text files , often used for microdata, the utility also produces information on: Minimum line length Maximum line length Number of records Constant records flag (ie, all lines are of the same length) Row and column of non-ASCII characters A count of null characters Flag for DOS/Windows formatting (ie, carriage return + line feed as opposed to just a line feed). For files in SAS, SPSS and Stata formats (ie, .sas7bdat, .sav and .dta) the utility will provide information on: Number of cases (reported as rows) Number of variables (reported as columns) Note that statistical package files will always be reported as rectangular due to the limitations of parsing them. Output formats are: Plain text Comma Separated Value (ie, a spreadsheet), and depending on which application, tab-separated or pipe-separated values JSON. This JSON doesn\u2019t conform to any particular standard, but is valid JSON object \u2014 one object for all the files.

For data distributors damage output can be included as a text file with your data so that you and end users can verify and identify what they\u2019ve downloaded Create detailed version notes with one command Manage changes in file structure using digests which are unique to a particular version of a file, instead of relying on easily changeable file names Easily find duplicate files For researchers damage an help with creating descriptive documentation which is required for your research data deposit damage output ensures the integrity of your data set when used by others Detailed software/installation instructions \u00b6 There are many ways to install damage . Which one is best for you depends on your Using pipx \u00b6 Using pipx is the easiest way to make sure things are up-to-date. Use this if you: Are happy using the terminal/command line Are unlikely to use the damage package in your own code pipx install damage Caveats: Although everything will be installed, you will need to invoke the Damage GUI application from the terminal/command line.

Damage is designed to ease the distribution of data by providing a standardized listing of checksums and record lengths, which ideally will be distributed with the data set itself. This allows end-users to duplicate the procedure and compare results. If you\u2019re a data provider Use Damage to create a data manifest which you distribute with your data and documentation. This will allow users to verify that they have exactly what you intend them to have. If you\u2019re a data user Use Damage to verify that what you\u2019ve received from a data provider is what they\u2019re supposed to have given you. Bonus points If both parties shorten file paths and use the same directory structure, then the manifests can be compared. If the checksums of the manifests are not identical, then the data structures are not identical. Why is there no printer dialogue when I print from Damage ? The application prints text directly to default printer; there\u2019s no formatting. For more nicely formatted text, consider opening the output document in a text editor or spreadsheet. I can\u2019t edit values in Damage\u2019s csv mode? This is the expected behaviour. If you need to edit the CSV, please use a spreadsheet application. Why would you call the software \u201cdamage\u201d? Command line utility names are not easy to remember. Typing \u2018damage [filename\u2019] for the first time will burn the name into your memory. Why does the software hang during examination of text files? Most of the time, the software hasn\u2019t actually crashed; it\u2019s still doing its processing, possibly more slowly than one would like. There can be two reasons for this: Every character in a text file is examined; if your file is large, the amount of time this requires is not negligble. There have been instances of file corruption where data is replaced by null characters . Using versions previous to v0.1.3 output the row and column location of every such character, which takes a very long time if there are, as has happened, tens of millions of these characters. Versions >= v0.1.3 changed this behaviour and simply output a count. I try to run damage from Windows explorer or Finder and it doesn\u2019t work. What\u2019s going on? If you installed with pipx or pip , make sure you are running the GUI version of damage and not the command line version. Multi-platform capablity is hard. I develop mostly for Mac and Linux, and Windows errors can slip through the cracks. If you are having problems, please report an issue . What\u2019s all this PATH and /usr/local/bin stuff? PATH is an environment variable on your computer which allows programs to invoked without laboriously typing out the full location of the program. On linux-like systems, /usr/local/bin is already part of the PATH environment variable, so just moving/copying the damage executable file there will do all the work in one step. If you are using damage.py , ie, you installed fcheck with pip , you don\u2019t need to do any of this unless you really want to.","title":"Frequently asked questions"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"What is the point of this application? Damage is designed to ease the distribution of data by providing a standardized listing of checksums and record lengths, which ideally will be distributed with the data set itself. This allows end-users to duplicate the procedure and compare results. If you\u2019re a data provider Use Damage to create a data manifest which you distribute with your data and documentation. This will allow users to verify that they have exactly what you intend them to have. If you\u2019re a data user Use Damage to verify that what you\u2019ve received from a data provider is what they\u2019re supposed to have given you. Bonus points If both parties shorten file paths and use the same directory structure, then the manifests can be compared. If the checksums of the manifests are not identical, then the data structures are not identical. Why is there no printer dialogue when I print from Damage ? The application prints text directly to default printer; there\u2019s no formatting. For more nicely formatted text, consider opening the output document in a text editor or spreadsheet. I can\u2019t edit values in Damage\u2019s csv mode? This is the expected behaviour. If you need to edit the CSV, please use a spreadsheet application. Why would you call the software \u201cdamage\u201d? Command line utility names are not easy to remember. Typing \u2018damage [filename\u2019] for the first time will burn the name into your memory. Why does the software hang during examination of text files? Most of the time, the software hasn\u2019t actually crashed; it\u2019s still doing its processing, possibly more slowly than one would like. There can be two reasons for this: Every character in a text file is examined; if your file is large, the amount of time this requires is not negligble. There have been instances of file corruption where data is replaced by null characters . Using versions previous to v0.1.3 output the row and column location of every such character, which takes a very long time if there are, as has happened, tens of millions of these characters. Versions >= v0.1.3 changed this behaviour and simply output a count. I try to run damage from Windows explorer or Finder and it doesn\u2019t work. What\u2019s going on? If you installed with pipx or pip , make sure you are running the GUI version of damage and not the command line version. Multi-platform capablity is hard. I develop mostly for Mac and Linux, and Windows errors can slip through the cracks. If you are having problems, please report an issue . What\u2019s all this PATH and /usr/local/bin stuff? PATH is an environment variable on your computer which allows programs to invoked without laboriously typing out the full location of the program. On linux-like systems, /usr/local/bin is already part of the PATH environment variable, so just moving/copying the damage executable file there will do all the work in one step. If you are using damage.py , ie, you installed fcheck with pip , you don\u2019t need to do any of this unless you really want to.","title":"Frequently asked questions"},{"location":"how_to_use_damage/","text":"How to use the Damage console utility \u00b6 Documentation is for the console utility.

Note that releases for all architectures are not available. Ironically, Damage could check the integrity of your download by verifying its checksum. If you wish to do so (and it\u2019s good practice to do so), you could use the damage command line tool or another utility such as openssl . Using the precompiled binary files \u00b6 The precompiled versions are just \u201cnormal\u201d programs. The command line utility is not included. See the the note if you\u2019ve installed with pipx or pip . For Microsoft Windows \u00b6 The Windows application is a portable file; it does not require installation. Simply unzip it and run damage.exe . Move it to wherever you like; the Program Files directory is a common choice. For MacOS \u00b6 Double-click the DMG file, and it should automatically appear in a Finder window. Drag the icon to the Applications folder. If, for some reason, you don\u2019t want to put it in the Applications folder, you can drag it somewhere else. Note that the developer(s) of Damage do not have an Apple developer account. This means that you may recive a warning about an unidentified developer as per this page: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac . To start the application (for the first time only), you may have to right click on the application, select Open then agree to the conditions. Or whatever it is Apple decide to do, because it changes from release to release. For Linux \u00b6 I no longer have an x86_64 or AMD64 processor Linux OS, so there is no guarantee that Linux will be represented as a download. Such is life. Unzip the download. Like the Windows utility, it is a single file. Traditionally, you can place that file in /usr/local/bin or opt/bin , or if that is not a solution, another user-centred location is ~/.local/bin . Usage \u00b6 On running the application, you will be presented with an essentially blank interface. The workflow consists of the following easy steps: Set your preferences Select files Create the manifest Save (or print) the output The Preferences window \u00b6 The output of Damage , like all other software, will be dependent on the preferences you set. While the defaults are fine, you may need to match your output to someone else\u2019s manifest, or you don\u2019t like what the defaults are. To do this, use the Preferences window, available via the Edit/Preferences menu item. The options Shorten file paths in output : Given a list of files, the common portion of the file path will be removed in the output. For example, given two files path/to/dir_a/x.txt and path/to/dir_b/y.txt , the output will show dir_a/x.txt and dir_b/y.txt . Rectangularity check : For plain text files and statistical software files, check for line length and number of records. If a text file is meant to be a rectangular file, ie, each record or line contains the same number of observations, thus having the same line length, then the output will show constant records , and all the lines will have the same length. In the case of statistical files, the line length refers to the number of fields , ie, variables. If, for instance, the value is not constant, that means that the data set is truncated. Recursively add files from directories : When adding a folder, add all the files found in sub-folders as well. So, if folder A contains folders B and C, any files found in A, B and C will be added, all the way to to the point where no further folders are found. Include hidden files : While there are many ways to hide files, this checkbox will include files that begin with . , such as .DS_Store . Or, if you are using directories, it will include files in directories such as .git . Normally this would be unchecked unless you have a special use case. Hash type : Cryptographic hash algorithm used to check for file integrity. The most commonly used are likely md5 and sha256 . If checking downloaded files for integrity, use the algorithm stated on the download site. For example, on the release page for this software product, you will see that the download checksums are listed as sha256 . If checksums don\u2019t match, then file integrity is compromised. Output format : Output format of the resulting manifest. txt: Human readable plain text format csv: Comma separated value spreadsheet json: Javascript Object Notation dictionary for times when machine readable output is required. Selecting files \u00b6 You have several options to select files to analyze. Add individual files with either the Add Files button or the the menu under Files/Add Files If you would like to add an entire folder of files, select the Add Folder button or the Files/Add Folder menu. Files (with their full paths) will be added to the left sidebar, or File Section . In some cases, what seems like a file doesn\u2019t appear in the list. For instance, should you attempt to add a Mac application (which, in the Finder, looks like a single item), it will be ignored. Mac Applications are really folders, despite looking like single files. Should you really need to add an item such as this, use the Add Folder function. Removing files \u00b6 If you wish to edit the list of files, select the files you wish to remove from the File Section and use the Remove Files button, or use the convenient menu item Files/Remove Files Generating the manifest \u00b6 To generate the manifest for your selected files, hit the Generate Manifest button, use the Actions/Create Manifest menu item, or use the plaform specific short combination. Note that this operation may take a while depending on the size and complexity of the file(s) you are analyzing. Notably, statistical files with hundreds of thousands of records (or millions) may take a while. Don\u2019t assume the application has crashed if results are not instant. Once completed, the output is shown in the cleverly labelled Output Section . At this point, you can edit the results (although it\u2019s not clear why you would). More importantly, though, the saving and printing options will now be available. Output \u00b6 To save, select Actions/Save Output or use the shortcut key combination. The output will be saved with the correct extension automatically. To print, select Actions/Print Output or use the shortcut key combination. The output will be sent immediately to your default printer. Note : There is no printer selection and formatting dialogue; the manifest is sent to the printer as plain text. Note that in the case of csv files, this means that you will get raw csv, not a nice table. If you require nicely tabulated and formatted data, use a spreadsheet to open the created csv file.
