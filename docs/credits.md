Many thanks to Jeremy Buhler for coming up with the *damage* name.

Reading statistical file metadata is made very simple with [pyreadstat](https://pypi.org/project/pyreadstat/).

Without [pydoc-markdown](https://pydoc-markdown.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org), documentation would have been a lot harder.
